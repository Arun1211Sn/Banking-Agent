## 1. AI System and Core Banking System Integration

### **How the Connection Works**

Our voice banking system uses **LiveKit's enterprise-grade real-time communication platform** as the bridge between AI processing and your core banking system. Here's the technical integration approach:

#### **Three-Layer Architecture:**

1. **Mobile Application Layer**
   - Captures voice input through wake word detection ("Rubio")
   - Processes voice commands using real-time speech-to-text
   - Manages secure authentication (biometric/PIN)
   - Displays dynamic banking UI based on voice commands

2. **LiveKit Cloud Platform** 
   - AI Agent processes natural language and identifies banking intents
   - RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system enables secure method invocation
   - Real-time WebRTC communication ensures sub-second response times
   - End-to-end encryption maintains bank-grade security

3. **Banking Core System Integration**
   - Secure API gateway interfaces with existing banking infrastructure
   - Transaction processor handles all financial operations
   - Fraud detection and compliance monitoring in real-time
   - Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance

#### **RPC-Based Communication**

The system uses LiveKit's RPC framework to create secure, real-time connections:

```
Voice Command â†’ AI Processing â†’ RPC Method Call â†’ Banking API â†’ Database â†’ Response
```

**Example Flow:**
- User says: "Check my balance"
- AI identifies intent: `getAccountBalance()`
- RPC call: `client.getAccountBalance()` 
- Banking API queries account data
- Response: "Your checking account balance is $15,420.75"

### **Key Integration Benefits:**

- **Real-time Performance**: Sub-second response times
- **Secure Communication**: End-to-end encryption with WebRTC
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles thousands of concurrent users
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Server can initiate client actions (authentication requests)
